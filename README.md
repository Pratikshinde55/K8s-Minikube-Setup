**There are many ways to create K8s cluster:**
1. EKS
2. AKS
3. GKE
4. Kubeadm
5. Minikube


Here I use Minikube for Multi-Node Cluster:
Note: The Cluster is creating is automatic by Minikube we just put our requirement but this is not give fully customize option like Kubeadm.

How to Install Minikube on Window:
Search on Browser "kubernetes minikube install"
[Minikube-Download-link](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fwindows%2Fx86-64%2Fstable%2F.exe+downloa)
